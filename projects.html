                    A web application made in React for my Senior Project at the University of Nevada, Reno 
                    in 2021. I primarily designed and implemented the UI, routing, and webcam display, as 
                    well as assisting in styling various components across the site. The goal of the project 
                    is to better inform drivers about road conditions, and to make driving on winter roads in 
                    Nevada and California safer. It does this by providing a user-friendly interface that 
                    displays live footage and weather information for locations along a user’s chosen path.

                    The Nevada Sagebrush is the main website that I worked on in my Webmaster position. 
                    Even though I did not create the site, I performed a significant amount of maintenance 
                    on the site. I set up the advertising slots in the header and sidebar that rotate between 
                    multiple clients, created the popup ad that is currently in place as well as the ad slot 
                    under the navigation bar, migrated the site twice to different hosting providers, and 
                    set up the server that it currently is hosted at.

                    A game made as an entry in the 2019 Biggest Little Hackathon for UNR’s ACM chapter, created 
                    with C# in Unity. I created, edited, and formatted all of the graphics and audio for the 
                    project, including writing original music. The goal of the game was to work together with 
                    another person to survive as long as possible flying around space. One person would pilot 
                    the ship, while the other player shot at enemy ships as well as repaired the ship’s systems. 
                    If any system took too much damage, the system would go offline until it was repaired.

                    A game built from scratch using the Ogre engine, made for a final project in my game engine 
                    architecture class. The player faces waves of increasingly stronger enemies, and can only 
                    use weapons found throughout the map, each with limited amounts of ammo. I handled all of 
                    the visuals as well as sound design for the game, as well as composed original theme music.
