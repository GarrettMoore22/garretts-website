                I am 22 years old, and will receive a Bachelor of Science from the University of Nevada, Reno in May 2021. 
                The first programming languages I learned were C-based, learning both C and C++. Through experience at my 
                internship with Alacrity AI, I learned Python with some Bash Scripting. I have a strong HTML/CSS/Javascript 
                background from my current Webmaster job with the University, with specific experience in Wordpress and 
                Javascript frameworks such as React. I am interested in many different areas of Computer Science, with an 
                emphasis in Gaming, Interface Design, and Front-End Web Development.
